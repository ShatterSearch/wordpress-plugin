# Shatter Search

We offer web services for cannabis brands!

ðŸ‘‹ hello@shattersearch.com

Our mission is to become a leading provider of web services & software created specifically for cannabis extract brands.

### This plugin is intended for:
Brands that manufacture cannabis extracts (vape pens, wax, shatter, solventless extracts, CBD products, etc)

Dispensaries and delivery services that carry cannabis extract products

### Why use this plugin?
This plugin adds or enhances functionality on your website that helps connect your customers with the retailers that carry your products.

You can build a relatively "dumb" website.  Let us handle the heavy lifting.

We help curate photos of your products shared on social media by your customers and retailers.

We syndicate information about your brand through our website, mobile apps, and social media channels.

### Free Onboarding
Getting started should be pretty easy, but we're here to help if you want a hand.

# All Implementation Options
## Javascript Widget
The JavaScript widget installs in minutes on just about any website.

Generate a `<script>` tag through the [Business Control Panel](https://shattersearch.com/biz) and add it to your website.

The widget is optimized for fast loading and is cached and served by a CDN.

Data for the widget is served by the Shatter Search API upon page load and content is ***injected*** into your website.

**JavaScript Widget Demo:** [Fake Cannabis Brand](https://fakecannabisbrand.xyz)

The [widget documentation](https://fakecannabisbrand.xyz) provides more information on customization.

## WordPress Plugin
Rather than connecting to Shatter Search servers to fetch this data, the plugin stores a local copy of the data pertaining to your store locator and product drops.

The content is served by your WordPress website and included directly in the page's HTML - which may have a positive impact on Search Engine Optimization.

## Shatter Search Website Builder
Let us take the wheel.

We have a full-featured website builder for cannabis extract brands on the way.

Contact us for early access to the beta at a discounted rate - help@shattersearch.com

## Shatter Search API
API access is available upon request and allows you to build out custom implementations.
